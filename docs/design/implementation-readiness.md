# Multi-Session Isolation Implementation Readiness

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Ready to Implement
**Branch**: main (c9fef46)

## Executive Summary

The multi-session-isolation design document is **valid and ready for implementation**. The design accurately reflects the current architecture and proposes a solid solution. Recent API changes (PR #10 - api minimization) do not affect the proposed design.

---

## Current Codebase State (main branch)

### Recent Changes (PR #10 - api minimization)
- **Internal types privatized**: `TreeNode` → `treeNode`, `Message` → `message`
- **API cleanup**: Removed package-level helpers, unused types
- **Public API**: Reduced from 65+ to ~36 symbols
- **No breaking changes for users**: Internal implementation details hidden

### Current Architecture

**SessionStore** (session.go):
```go
type SessionStore interface {
    Get(sessionID string) interface{}
    Set(sessionID string, state interface{})
    Delete(sessionID string)
}
```
- Currently stores `connState` per HTTP session
- Used only for HTTP requests (not WebSocket)
- Not integrated with WebSocket connection lifecycle

**Broadcasting** (mount.go):
```go
type Broadcaster interface {
    Send() error // Per-connection only
}

type BroadcastAware interface {
    OnConnect(ctx context.Context, b Broadcaster) error
    OnDisconnect()
}
```
- Per-connection broadcasting only
- Each connection gets independent stores
- No multi-user broadcasting capability

**Connection Management**:
- WebSocket: Each connection clones stores independently
- HTTP: SessionStore tracks state per HTTP session
- No sharing between WebSocket connections
- No sharing between tabs (each connection isolated)

---

## Design Doc Validation

### ✅ Current Architecture Description - ACCURATE

The design doc correctly describes:
- Per-connection store cloning in WebSocket
- SessionStore interface for HTTP sessions
- Lack of integration between HTTP and WebSocket flows
- No concept of session groups

### ✅ Proposed Interfaces - COMPATIBLE

All proposed interfaces use public API correctly:
```go
// New interface - no conflicts
type Authenticator interface {
    Identify(r *http.Request) (userID string, err error)
    GetSessionGroup(r *http.Request, userID string) (groupID string, err error)
}

// Refactored interface - backward compatible change
type SessionStore interface {
    Get(groupID string) Stores        // Changed from interface{}
    Set(groupID string, stores Stores) // Changed from interface{}
    Delete(groupID string)
    List() []string
}

// New interface - extends http.Handler
type LiveHandler interface {
    http.Handler
    Broadcast(filter func(userID string) bool) error
    BroadcastToUsers(userIDs ...string) error
    BroadcastToGroup(groupID string) error
}
```

### ✅ Implementation Plan - VALID

The 10-phase implementation plan is accurate:
1. Phase 1: Authenticator infrastructure
2. Phase 2: Refactor SessionStore
3. Phase 3: ConnectionRegistry
4. Phase 4: Template configuration
5. Phase 5: Integrate with mount handler
6. Phase 6: Broadcasting system
7. Phase 7: E2E testing
8. Phase 8: Example applications
9. Phase 9: Documentation
10. Phase 10: Optional extensions (Redis, JWT)

**Estimated Effort**: 9-11 sessions

## Compatibility Notes

### No Conflicts with Recent Changes

The recent API minimization (PR #10) does not affect the design:
- ✅ Design doc doesn't reference private types (treeNode, message, etc.)
- ✅ All proposed interfaces use public types (Store, Stores, ActionContext)
- ✅ Template.Handle() already returns http.Handler (will return LiveHandler)
- ✅ No dependencies on removed functions

### Minor Naming Consideration

**Current Broadcasting**:
- `Broadcaster` interface (per-connection Send())
- `BroadcastAware` interface (OnConnect/OnDisconnect)

**Proposed Broadcasting**:
- `LiveHandler.Broadcast(filter)` (multi-user)
- `LiveHandler.BroadcastToUsers(userIDs...)`
- `LiveHandler.BroadcastToGroup(groupID)`

**Resolution**: The existing `Broadcaster` is per-connection and serves a different purpose. Both can co-exist:
- Keep `Broadcaster` for per-connection server-initiated updates
- Add `LiveHandler.Broadcast*()` for multi-user broadcasting
- Rename if needed during implementation

## Breaking Changes Analysis

### SessionStore Interface Change

**Before**:
```go
Get(sessionID string) interface{}
Set(sessionID string, state interface{})
```

**After**:
```go
Get(groupID string) Stores
Set(groupID string, stores Stores)
```

**Impact**: Breaking change to SessionStore interface

**Mitigation**:
- Library is unreleased (currently alpha)
- No external users to migrate
- Clear migration guide in documentation (Phase 9)

### Default Behavior Change

**Current**: Each connection gets independent stores (per-connection isolation)

**Proposed**: Connections in same browser share stores (browser-based session groups)

**Impact**: Behavior change for anonymous users

**Mitigation**:
- New behavior is more intuitive (tabs share state)
- Matches user expectations (Gmail-style multi-tab)
- Can opt-out by providing custom Authenticator
- Documented in migration guide

## Recommended Next Steps

### Step 1: Create Implementation Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feat/multi-session-isolation
```

### Step 2: Start with Phase 1 - Authenticator Infrastructure

**Files to create**:
- `auth.go` - Authenticator interface and implementations

**Implementation order**:
1. Define `Authenticator` interface
2. Implement `AnonymousAuthenticator`
3. Implement `BasicAuthenticator` helper
4. Write unit tests for authenticators
5. Test cookie management (set/get/persistence)

**Estimated effort**: 1-1.5 sessions

### Step 3: Follow Implementation Plan

Work through phases 1-6 sequentially (dependencies exist), then phases 7-10 can be done in any order.

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Anonymous users share data across browser tabs by default
- ✅ Different browsers have independent data
- ✅ Custom authentication works (Basic, JWT, etc.)
- ✅ Broadcasting to filtered users works
- ✅ In-memory session storage is default
- ✅ Custom session storage (Redis) is possible

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Zero breaking changes for new apps
- ✅ Zero configuration for common case
- ✅ Thread-safe for concurrent connections
- ✅ Performance: no significant overhead
- ✅ Documentation: comprehensive guides

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ Unit tests for all new components
- ✅ Integration tests for WebSocket + HTTP flows
- ✅ E2E tests for multi-tab scenarios
- ✅ Example apps demonstrate key use cases

---

## Conclusion

**The design document is valid and the implementation can begin immediately.**

All prerequisites are met:
- Current architecture understood
- Proposed solution is sound
- API compatibility verified
- Implementation plan is clear
- Success criteria defined

**Recommended approach**: Start with Phase 1 (Authenticator) and work through the 10-phase plan sequentially.
