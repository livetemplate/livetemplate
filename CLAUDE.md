## Project Overview

LiveTemplate is a Go library for ultra-efficient HTML template update generation using **tree-based optimization**. It provides secure multi-tenant isolation with JWT-based authentication and achieves exceptional bandwidth savings (92%+) through intelligent hierarchical template parsing and static/dynamic content separation with client-side caching.

**Current Status**: v1.0 implementation COMPLETED with tree-based optimization achieving 92%+ bandwidth savings ✅
**Achievements**: Production-ready architecture, multi-tenant JWT security, comprehensive testing (52+ test cases)
**Performance**: Single field 94.4%, multi-field 81.2%, nested fields 66.7% bandwidth savings
**Documentation**: Complete v1.0 documentation suite updated for tree-based optimization
**Next**: Template source registry, method resolution enhancement, production integration
**Future**: Advanced optimization and enhanced features in v2.0+

## Go Template Constructs Reference (text/template)

**IMPORTANT**: This comprehensive reference covers ALL Go template constructs for proper tree-based optimization in LiveTemplate.

### Core Template Syntax
- **Delimiters**: `{{` and `}}` (customizable via `.Delims(left, right)`)
- **Text**: Everything outside `{{}}` is copied unchanged
- **Whitespace Control**: Use `-` to trim whitespace (e.g., `{{- .Field -}}`)

### Template Actions (Complete List)

#### 1. Comments
- `{{/* comment */}}` - Comments (do not nest, can be multi-line)

#### 2. Pipeline Output
- `{{pipeline}}` - Output textual representation of pipeline value
- `{{.}}` - Current data object (dot)
- `{{.Field}}` - Field access
- `{{.Method}}` - Method call (niladic)
- `{{.Method arg1 arg2}}` - Method call with arguments

#### 3. Variables
- `{{$var := pipeline}}` - Variable declaration and assignment
- `{{$var = pipeline}}` - Variable reassignment  
- `{{$}}` - Root data object
- `{{$var}}` - Variable access

#### 4. Conditional Blocks
- `{{if pipeline}} T1 {{end}}` - Simple conditional
- `{{if pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}` - If-else
- `{{if pipeline}} T1 {{else if pipeline}} T2 {{else}} T0 {{end}}` - Chained conditionals

#### 5. Iteration (Range)
- `{{range pipeline}} T1 {{end}}` - Basic range over slice/array/map/channel
- `{{range pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}` - Range with fallback for empty
- `{{range $index, $element := pipeline}} T1 {{end}}` - Range with index/key
- `{{range $element := pipeline}} T1 {{end}}` - Range with element only

#### 6. Loop Control
- `{{break}}` - Exit innermost range loop
- `{{continue}}` - Skip to next iteration in range loop

#### 7. Context Manipulation (With)
- `{{with pipeline}} T1 {{end}}` - Execute T1 with pipeline value as dot
- `{{with pipeline}} T1 {{else}} T0 {{end}}` - With block with fallback

#### 8. Template Invocation
- `{{template "name"}}` - Execute named template with current data
- `{{template "name" pipeline}}` - Execute named template with pipeline data

#### 9. Block Definition/Override
- `{{block "name" pipeline}} T1 {{end}}` - Define template block with default content

#### 10. Template Definition (Parse-time)
- `{{define "name"}} T1 {{end}}` - Define named template

### Built-in Functions (Complete List)

#### Comparison Functions
- `eq` - Equal (`{{if eq .A .B}}`)
- `ne` - Not equal
- `lt` - Less than
- `le` - Less than or equal
- `gt` - Greater than

## Architecture (v1.0 Completed)

LiveTemplate v1.0 implements a secure two-layer architecture with tree-based optimization:

**Security Foundation**:
1. **Application** - Multi-tenant isolation with JWT-based authentication
2. **Page** - Isolated user sessions with stateless design for horizontal scaling  
3. **TokenService** - Standard JWT tokens with replay protection
4. **PageRegistry** - Thread-safe page storage with TTL cleanup

**Tree-Based Optimization System**:
1. **TemplateAwareGenerator** - Hierarchical template parsing and boundary detection
2. **SimpleTreeGenerator** - Single unified strategy for all template patterns
3. **TemplateBoundary** - Template construct classification (static, fields, conditionals, ranges)
4. **SimpleTreeData** - Client-compatible data structures with static/dynamic separation
5. **Template Boundary Parser** - Supports nested conditionals, ranges, and complex structures
6. **Static Content Caching** - Client-side caching for maximum bandwidth efficiency

**Current Components**:
- `application.go` - Multi-tenant Application management with JWT security
- `page.go` - Page lifecycle and fragment generation using tree-based strategy
- `internal/strategy/template_aware_generator.go` - Template parsing and field evaluation
- `internal/strategy/static_dynamic.go` - Tree-based fragment generation
- `internal/strategy/template_aware_static_dynamic.go` - Enhanced template-aware optimization

## API Design (v1.0 Completed)

The v1.0 API provides secure multi-tenant architecture with zero-configuration tree-based optimization:

### Core Types (v1.0)
```go
type Application struct { /* private fields */ }
type Page struct { /* private fields */ }
type Fragment struct {
    ID       string      `json:"id"`
    Strategy string      `json:"strategy"`   // "tree_based"
    Action   string      `json:"action"`     // "update_tree"
    Data     interface{} `json:"data"`       // SimpleTreeData structure
}
```

### Application Management
- `NewApplication(options ...ApplicationOption) *Application` - Create isolated application instance
- `app.NewPage(tmpl *html.Template, data interface{}, options ...PageOption) (*Page, error)` - Create isolated page session
- `app.GetPage(token string) (*Page, error)` - Retrieve page by JWT token (with cross-app isolation)
- `app.Close() error` - Cleanup application resources

### Page Operations
- `page.Render() (string, error)` - Render initial HTML with fragment annotations
- `page.RenderFragments(ctx context.Context, newData interface{}) ([]Fragment, error)` - Generate fragment updates
- `page.GetToken() string` - Get JWT token for page access
- `page.Close() error` - Cleanup page resources

### Legacy API (Current - to be replaced)
- Current `Renderer` type and methods will be deprecated in favor of Application/Page architecture
- Migration path will be provided for existing code
- Focus on backward compatibility during transition period

## Tree-Based Optimization (v1.0 Completed)

LiveTemplate v1.0 implements **Tree-Based Optimization** - a single unified strategy that adapts to all template patterns:

**Tree-Based Approach**:
- **Template Parsing**: Hierarchical parsing into structured boundaries (static content, fields, conditionals, ranges)
- **Static/Dynamic Separation**: Identifies static HTML content vs dynamic template values  
- **Tree Structure Generation**: Creates minimal client data structures similar to Phoenix LiveView
- **Client-Side Caching**: Static content cached client-side, only dynamic values transmitted

**Single Unified Strategy Benefits**:
- **Simplicity**: One strategy handles all template patterns - no complex selection logic
- **Consistency**: Predictable behavior across all template constructs
- **Performance**: 92%+ bandwidth savings for typical real-world templates
- **Compatibility**: Works with any template complexity without fallbacks

**Tree Structure Examples**:

**Simple Field Template**:
```html
<p>Hello {{.Name}}!</p>
```
**Generated Structure**:
```json
{
  "s": ["<p>Hello ", "!</p>"],
  "0": "Alice"
}
```

**Nested Conditional in Range**:
```html
{{range .Users}}<div>{{if .Active}}✓{{else}}✗{{end}} {{.Name}}</div>{{end}}
```
**Generated Structure**:
```json
{
  "s": ["", ""],
  "0": [
    {"s": ["<div>", " ", "</div>"], "0": {"s": ["✓"], "0": ""}, "1": "Alice"},
    {"s": ["<div>", " ", "</div>"], "0": {"s": ["✗"], "0": ""}, "1": "Bob"}
  ]
}
```

**Template Boundary Support**:
- **Simple Fields**: `{{.Name}}` - Direct value substitution
- **Conditionals**: `{{if .Active}}...{{else}}...{{end}}` - Branch selection
- **Ranges**: `{{range .Items}}...{{end}}` - List iteration with individual item tracking  
- **Nested Structures**: Complex combinations with proper hierarchical parsing
- **Static Content**: Preserved and cached client-side for maximum efficiency

## Testing Strategy (v1.0 Focus)

**Test-Driven Development**:
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all new features
- Security tests must pass for v1.0 release  
- Performance benchmarks validate 92%+ bandwidth reduction
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage

**Test Categories**:
- **Unit Tests** (60%): Individual component behavior
- **Integration Tests** (30%): Component interaction and workflows
- **Security Tests** (10%): Multi-tenant isolation and JWT authentication

**Critical Test Requirements for v1.0**:
- Zero cross-application data leaks in testing
- JWT implementation passes security audit
- Tree-based optimization achieves 92%+ bandwidth savings for typical templates
- Template boundary parsing accuracy >95% across all Go template constructs
- Static/dynamic separation works correctly for nested structures
- Client-compatible tree structures (Phoenix LiveView format)
- Memory usage bounded under concurrent load (1000+ pages)
- P95 update generation latency <75ms for tree-based fragments

**Legacy Testing**:
- Current tests in `examples/e2e/` will be migrated to new architecture
- Table-driven tests maintained for backward compatibility during transition
- TDD methodology continues with focus on v1.0 security and reliability

## Development Patterns (v1.0 Implementation)

<!-- BACKLOG.MD GUIDELINES START -->
# Instructions for the usage of Backlog.md CLI Tool

## 1. Source of Truth

- Tasks live under **`backlog/tasks/`** (drafts under **`backlog/drafts/`**).
- Every implementation decision starts with reading the corresponding Markdown task file.
- Project documentation is in **`backlog/docs/`**.
- Project decisions are in **`backlog/decisions/`**.

## 2. Defining Tasks

### Understand the Scope and the purpose

Ask questions to the user if something is not clear or ambiguous.
Break down the task into smaller, manageable parts if it is too large or complex.

### **Title (one liner)**

Use a clear brief title that summarizes the task.

### **Description**: (The **"why"**)

Provide a concise summary of the task purpose and its goal. Do not add implementation details here. It
should explain the purpose and context of the task. Code snippets should be avoided.

### **Acceptance Criteria**: (The **"what"**)

List specific, measurable outcomes that define what means to reach the goal from the description. Use checkboxes (
`- [ ]`) for tracking.
When defining `## Acceptance Criteria` for a task, focus on **outcomes, behaviors, and verifiable requirements** rather
than step-by-step implementation details.
Acceptance Criteria (AC) define *what* conditions must be met for the task to be considered complete.
They should be testable and confirm that the core purpose of the task is achieved.
**Key Principles for Good ACs:**

- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on the result, not the method.
- **Testable/Verifiable:** Each criterion should be something that can be objectively tested or verified.
- **Clear and Concise:** Unambiguous language.
- **Complete:** Collectively, ACs should cover the scope of the task.
- **User-Focused (where applicable):** Frame ACs from the perspective of the end-user or the system's external behavior.

    - *Good Example:* "- [ ] User can successfully log in with valid credentials."
    - *Good Example:* "- [ ] System processes 1000 requests per second without errors."
    - *Bad Example (Implementation Step):* "- [ ] Add a new function `handleLogin()` in `auth.ts`."

### Task file

Once a task is created it will be stored in `backlog/tasks/` directory as a Markdown file with the format
`task-<id> - <title>.md` (e.g. `task-42 - Add GraphQL resolver.md`).

### Task Breakdown Strategy

When breaking down features:

1. Identify the foundational components first
2. Create tasks in dependency order (foundations before features)
3. Ensure each task delivers value independently
4. Avoid creating tasks that block each other

### Additional task requirements

- Tasks must be **atomic** and **testable**. If a task is too large, break it down into smaller subtasks.
  Each task should represent a single unit of work that can be completed in a single PR.

- **Never** reference tasks that are to be done in the future or that are not yet created. You can only reference
  previous
  tasks (id < current task id).

- When creating multiple tasks, ensure they are **independent** and they do not depend on future tasks.   
  Example of wrong tasks splitting: task 1: "Add API endpoint for user data", task 2: "Define the user model and DB
  schema".  
  Example of correct tasks splitting: task 1: "Add system for handling API requests", task 2: "Add user model and DB
  schema", task 3: "Add API endpoint for user data".

## 3. Recommended Task Anatomy

```markdown
# task‑42 - Add GraphQL resolver

## Description (the why)

Short, imperative explanation of the goal of the task and why it is needed.

## Acceptance Criteria (the what)

- [ ] Resolver returns correct data for happy path
- [ ] Error response matches REST
- [ ] P95 latency ≤ 50 ms under 100 RPS

## Implementation Plan (the how) (added after putting the task in progress but before implementing any code change)

1. Research existing GraphQL resolver patterns
2. Implement basic resolver with error handling
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Write unit and integration tests
5. Benchmark performance under load

## Implementation Notes (imagine this is the PR description) (only added after finishing the code implementation of a task)

- Approach taken
- Features implemented or modified
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Modified or added files
```

## 6. Implementing Tasks

Mandatory sections for every task:

- **Implementation Plan**: (The **"how"**)  
  Outline the steps to achieve the task. Because the implementation details may
  change after the task is created, **the implementation plan must be added only after putting the task in progress**
  and before starting working on the task.
- **Implementation Notes**: (Imagine this is a PR note)  
  Start with a brief summary of what has been implemented. Document your approach, decisions, challenges, and any deviations from the plan. This
  section is added after you are done working on the task. It should summarize what you did and why you did it. Keep it
  concise but informative. Make it brief, explain ONLY the core changes and assume that others will read the code to understand the details.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not implement anything else that deviates from the **Acceptance Criteria**. If you need to
implement something that is not in the AC, update the AC first and then implement it or create a new task for it.

## 2. Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1 Identify work
backlog task list -s "To Do" --plain

# 2 Read details & documentation
backlog task 42 --plain
# Read also all documentation files in `backlog/docs/` directory.
# Read also all decision files in `backlog/decisions/` directory.

# 3 Start work: assign yourself & move column
backlog task edit 42 -a @{yourself} -s "In Progress"

# 4 Add implementation plan before starting
backlog task edit 42 --plan "1. Analyze current implementation\n2. Identify bottlenecks\n3. Refactor in phases"

# 5 Break work down if needed by creating subtasks or additional tasks
backlog task create "Refactor DB layer" -p 42 -a @{yourself} -d "Description" --ac "Tests pass,Performance improved"

# 6 Complete and mark Done
backlog task edit 42 -s Done --notes "Implemented GraphQL resolver with error handling and performance monitoring"
```

### 7. Final Steps Before Marking a Task as Done

Always ensure you have:

1. ✅ Marked all acceptance criteria as completed (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`)
2. ✅ Added an `## Implementation Notes` section documenting your approach
3. ✅ Run all tests and linting checks
4. ✅ Updated relevant documentation

## 8. Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is **Done** only when **ALL** of the following are complete:

1. **Acceptance criteria** checklist in the task file is fully checked (all `- [ ]` changed to `- [x]`).
2. **Implementation plan** was followed or deviations were documented in Implementation Notes.
3. **Automated tests** (unit + integration) cover new logic.
4. **Static analysis**: linter & formatter succeed.
5. **Documentation**:
    - All relevant docs updated (any relevant README file, backlog/docs, backlog/decisions, etc.).
    - Task file **MUST** have an `## Implementation Notes` section added summarising:
        - Approach taken
        - Features implemented or modified
        - Technical decisions and trade-offs
        - Modified or added files
6. **Review**: self review code.
7. **Task hygiene**: status set to **Done** via CLI (`backlog task edit <id> -s Done`).
8. **No regressions**: performance, security and licence checks green.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never mark a task as Done without completing ALL items above.

## 9. Handy CLI Commands

## 10. Tips for AI Agents

- **Always use `--plain` flag** when listing or viewing tasks for AI-friendly text output instead of using Backlog.md
  interactive UI.
- When users mention to create a task, they mean to create a task using Backlog.md CLI tool.

<!-- BACKLOG.MD GUIDELINES END -->
- memorize this workaround completely defeats the purpose of livetemplate. please fix the root cause and never do this workaround again
- lvt-id should be generated by the livetemplate libaray and never added directly to the html template
